<p> <font size ="5"> "Only if we help one another, hope will surely come." </font> </p>
<p> <font size ="3"> Based on our illustration, we used a flower as a symbol of hope because it is said that “Hope is the consequence of action” the same as a flower in which you need to act upon it in order for that flower to grow. Another reason on why we choose a flower as a symbol is because of its synonyms to love. Love and hope go together so well and in spite of the COVID 19, people never lose hope and love for one another. We just really need to love, care, and hope for one another in order to overcome this challenge for a bright and positive future ahead of us just like on what a gardener treats its plants in order for a flower to bloom.
